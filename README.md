# Opencv-Image-Processing
In these notebooks I have worked upon image processing mainly using the OPENCV library. 
Combined the use of webcam qith kernels to edit the input image in different ways. 
Made face, eye detector(basically any feature). This was done by the help of cascading(xml files), from the git page of opencv.
Also wrote a simple code to connect android camera with the laptop display.
